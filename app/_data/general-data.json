Nothing was too much trouble - he went out on a Saturday afternoon and returned early Monday morning- having had to wait for Mweb to connect us again- and got it working.  I am so grateful for his time and patience - when he had three members of the family , one in UK, one in Melbourne and one in NZ all asking his advise.  I would highly recommend Matt - nothing seemed to be too difficult or troublesome for him.. Top service - thank you so much Matt"

He ran tests for a few hours and everything was fine, so I came back and collected it, and he didn't even charge me anything! I found a faulty power cable when I got back and replaced it, but the problem persisted a few days later. I brought it back to Matt and he advised that replacing the power supply would likely fix the problem, so he did that and got it back to me that same day at around 5:30pm, working overtime just so that I could get my PC back before I left for Cape Town the next day. Superb service, would definitely recommend!"
